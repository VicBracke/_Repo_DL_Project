# Deep Learning Repository for PRDL & MLLB courses

This repository provides a comprehensive set of tools and analyses for understanding and applying Deep Learning techniques to the Animal Classification and X-ray Segmentation problem. It is created for the course of Predictive and Descriptive Learning & Machine Learning Lab, followed at the Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid (UPM). 

## Animal Classification
This repository has the following content related to the animal classification task:
- **AnimalRecognition_Data**: Contains the dataset used for animal classification.
- **AnimalRecognition_1_DataAnalysis.ipynb**: Notebook for exploring and understanding the dataset.
- **AnimalRecognition_2_CNN.ipynb**: Notebook implementing CNN models for animal classification, including the initial custom model, improvements via experiments, and transfer learning with EfficientNetB7.
- **AnimalRecognition_3_ML.ipynb**: Notebook for implementing machine learning workflows to compare traditional ML methods with deep learning.

## Xray Segmentation
This repository has the following content related to the X-ray segmentation task:
- **Data**: Contains the dataset used for X-ray segmentation.
- **UNet.ipynb**: Notebook implementing the UNet model for X-ray segmentation, including data analysis, training, and model evaluation.

## Neural Style Transfer
This contains the data and notebook related to the neural style transfer experiment:
- **Images**: Contains the two input images (Louvre and Monet) and the generated output image.
- **Neural_Style_Transfer.ipynb**: Notebook implementing neural style transfer to create an artistic blend of the input images using generative AI techniques.

## MONAI
This directory contains the following file for setting up the MONAI framework:
- **Requirements File**: File listing the dependencies required to create a \texttt{conda} environment for MONAI-based projects.
